# Hi! I'm Carlos Moreno 👋  
---

Data Science & Engineering student based in Guadalajara, Mexico. 🇲🇽 

I enjoy building clean data pipelines, applying machine learning, and turning data into insights people can actually use.

I’m especially interested in **impact-driven projects**, where data connects with real decisions from sports and mobility to geospatial and public data.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 B.Sc. in Data Science Engineering (8th semester) at ITESO
- 📤 Data Science Intern at [![Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hewlett_Packard_Enterprise-0096D6?style=flat&logo=hewlett-packard-enterprise&logoColor=white)](https://www.hpe.com)
- 📉 Volunteer as member of the Data Science & Engineering Student Society (2025–2026)
- 🌎 Native Spanish speaker, advanced English

I like working **end-to-end**: from data ingestion and cleaning, to modeling, and finally visualization through dashboards or interactive maps.

## 🔍 What I Work On

- Applied Machine Learning (classification & regression)
- Data cleaning, normalization & ETL pipelines
- Geospatial analysis & interactive mapping
- Sports analytics & performance data
- Data-driven decision making
- NLP fundamentals (tokenization, preprocessing)

## 🏟️ Sports & Data

Before writing code, sports — especially baseball — taught me how to think in patterns, preparation, and performance under pressure.  
Today, data science is the tool I use to analyze those same dynamics.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Player performance & development metrics  
- Decision-making under uncertainty  
- Translating complex analysis into tools coaches and teams can understand

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced geospatial analysis  
- Non-linear models for forecasting  
- Sports analytics workflows  
- Better data storytelling
